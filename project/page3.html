            Reineeee, I need to get this off my chest. I feel like I'm making things difficult for both of us because I know you already sense it. It's become too obvious üò≠ </p>



            <p> I'm not great with words, especially since this is my first time confessing. Usually, others confront me when they sense something, or sometimes they make the first move. Sorry, I'm really shy, broehwhus. But I refuse to let fear control me anymore! I need to tell you how I feel üôÅ
            </p>


           <p> Being around you has never been nice. Your photos on social media don't bring me joy like they used to. Instead, they make me feel like I'm watching a fading star or looking at a nice painting. It's not a pleasant feeling‚Äîit's something else entirely. These emotions weigh heavily on me that is becoming to hard to carry everyday, but they're also what make me feel connected to you. That's part of why I'm scared to confess and let this all out if that will be reason that i will be more sperated from you. But I can't keep hiding my feelings; it'll only make things worse. I'm struggling to find the right moment, and I feel like I'm being pushed away, or maybe it's just my own insecurities. I worry that I'm not good enough for you, that bringing you into my life will only hinder your own journey. Reality has hit me hard. Sometimes I muster the courage to confess, but most of the time, I feel out of place in your world. I've tried to integrate myself, to help you, to make you comfortable with me, but I still feel like you don't need me. Perhaps I've come too late into your life. Maybe you've already moved on. Maybe I'm reaching out for your hand, but you're reaching for someone else's. Seeing you happy in your stories or looking beautiful in your photos sometimes fills me with sadness and heartache. Your eyes tell me that I can't have you.
        </p>

            <p>Chances terrify me. I hate how my life seems predetermined, how I can't change it. I'm trapped in this reality.
            </p>

           <p> I know having me in your life isn't a priority right now, but I can't help how I feel. I like you. Just ignore this, hahahahhaha. I just want you to know that after all my failed relationships and loneliness, it's still you. It's always been you.
        </p>

            <p>Ever since I learned your name and saw your beautiful eyes meet my weird looking eye (sorry i hate it so bad),,, I realized that love isn't just a feeling; it's a person. Love is‚Äîyou. I don't understand how you do it, but you make me feel special. I never expected someone to care for me, especially when I tend to disappear. You're different, Reine. You're like a song I'll keep listening to until I can't hear anymore. Your presence is like the comforting rain, making those soothing sounds as it touches the ground. Your smile makes me feel safe, and your eyes light up my heart. Every aspect of you is unique, like a piece of art. Sometimes you're black and white, other times full of color. You may be a sad painting or a happy one, imperfect or flawless. But you're always a masterpiece.
            </p>

           <p> I don't how will you take this but please know that, you already made me happy reine i could never ask anything from you. Being with you and just looking at you from where you are has already fill those empty gaps of my heart. Whatever the universe will decide for this, pls remember that you are a meaningful part of my life.
        </p>
